# FastMONAI

### Data - The Medical Decathlon
The Medical Decathlon is a benchmark dataset for evaluating AI algorithms for medical image segmentation. The dataset includes 10 different medical imaging tasks, each with its own training and testing sets. The tasks include brain tumor segmentation, liver segmentation, and heart segmentation, among others.

The dataset contains 60 patients, with 10 patients per task. Each patient has multiple MRI sequences, and each sequence has a corresponding ground-truth segmentation. The images are provided in NIfTI format, and the ground-truth segmentations are provided as binary masks in NIfTI format as well.

The dataset is diverse and challenging, with variations in image quality, resolution, and pathology across different patients and imaging tasks. This makes it an ideal benchmark dataset for evaluating the performance of AI algorithms for medical image segmentation.

### What is FastMONAI


### The goal
The goal of the proposed idea is to develop an AI-powered system that can analyze MRI scans in real-time and automatically identify any tumors present. The system would then send this information to the doctor who is responsible for reviewing the scan, providing an objective and automated assessment of the scan before the doctor has had a chance to review it themselves.

The primary aim of this system is to improve the speed and accuracy of medical diagnosis, potentially saving valuable time and identifying tumors or other abnormalities that may have been missed by human review alone. By providing doctors with an objective assessment of the MRI scans, the system could also help to reduce the risk of human error and ensure that patients receive prompt and accurate diagnoses.
